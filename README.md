**You heard about Kirby and want to use it on your next project? You want to harness the power of Gulp? Then THIS is for you!**

Here's my personal (thus opinionated) Gulp+Kirby boilerplate, starring:
- [Kirby CMS v3](https://getkirby.com) - a fileâ€‘based CMS that's 'easy to setup, easy to use & flexible as hell'
- [Gulp v4](https://gulpjs.com) - the streaming build system

Although it's good practice to set up an environment closely resembling your production server (eg Vagrant, Docker, MAMP / XAMPP or Valet), feel free to use PHP's built-in development server or have a quick glance with `php -S localhost:4000 kirby/router.php`. If you want to integrate Gulp/Kirby StarterKit with a virtualized workflow, be sure to checkout [Vagrant/Kirby](https://github.com/S1SYPHOS/Vagrant-Kirby-Starter-Kit) or [Docker/Kirby](https://github.com/S1SYPHOS/Docker-Kirby-Starter-Kit) for a straightforward development experience.

Psst! Need the **Kirby 2 version**? Over [here](https://github.com/S1SYPHOS/Gulp-Kirby-Starter-Kit/tree/legacy).

## Features
This boilerplate provides a solid starting point that you can build upon:

Workflow:
- Sass / node-sass / libsass
- Webpack
- HTML / CSS / JS minification
- Image optimization
- SVG icon sprites
- Favicon generation
- Font subsetting
- Bourbon / Bitters / Neat
- ...

**Table of Contents**
- [1. Requirements](#requirements)
- [2. Getting started](#getting-started)
- [3. Configuration](#configuration)

## Requirements
- (recommended) Local development server running PHP 7.2 (or later)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 8 (or later) + NPM

In order to keep everything neat, each task resides in [its own file](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/javascript-and-gulpfiles#splitting-a-gulpfile) under `tasks/`.

Pre-installed Kirby plugins:
- [Minify HTML](https://github.com/afbora/kirby-minify-html) by @afbora
- [Fingerprint](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby3-fingerprint) by @bnomei

## Getting started
Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is installed on your system, then clone this repository and install its dependencies via [NPM](https://npmjs.org):

```text
# Composer
composer create-project s1syphos/gulp-kirby-starter-kit your-project

# Git
git clone https://github.com/S1SYPHOS/Gulp-Kirby-Starter-Kit.git your-project

# Installing dependencies
cd your-project && npm install
```

Now just type `npm start` and code away! If you want to build for production, use `npm run build`.

## Configuration
Tweaking the asset pipeline is pretty easy, as `config.js` comes with sensible defaults and extensive comments. Everything you need to know may be found there - otherwise open an issue and let me know!

### Development server
By default, this boilerplate uses PHP's built-in server. If you are using a local development server (as recommended above), just set `server.enable` to `false` and replace the default `browsersync:proxy`.

### Linting styles & scripts
Rules for linting styles and scripts *are excluded from this pattern* and located in `package.json` which provides a certain flexibility:

I prefer linting my files while editing them, which is supported by all major text editors such as GitHub's [Atom](https://atom.io), Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) (and even Adobe's [Brackets](http://brackets.io)) through plugins).

There are several ways to load the configuration object for both [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/configuration/#loading-the-configuration-object) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#configuring-eslint). As for now, they reside inside `package.json`.

### Cache-busting / Fingerprinting
For [cache busting](https://www.keycdn.com/support/what-is-cache-busting) via Kirby's built-in helper functions `css()` and `js()` and bnomei's feature-rich [fingerprint plugin](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby3-fingerprint) (plus filename hash, see `build/site/config/config.php`), just follow the next steps:

#### Apache
If you're using [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org) as your webserver and you are using a custom `.htaccess` ([this](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache) should get you going) for improved capabilities, add the following lines right after `RewriteBase`:

```text
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.+)\.([0-9]{10})\.(js|css)$ $1.$3 [L]
```

#### NGINX
If you're using [NGINX](https://nginx.org) as your webserver, add the following lines to your virtual host setup:

```text
location /assets {
  if (!-e $request_filename) {
    rewrite "^/(.+)\.([0-9]{10})\.(js|css)$" /$1.$3 break;
  }
}
```

### Critical CSS
A [critical CSS approach](https://web.dev/extract-critical-css) can be achieved by simply replacing this PHP snippet ..

```php
if (option('environment', 'development') === 'production') {
    echo Bnomei\Fingerprint::css('/assets/styles/main.min.css', ['integrity' => true]);
} else {
    echo css('assets/styles/main.css');
}
```

.. with this one:

```php
if (option('environment', 'development') === 'production') {
  // Critical
  $criticalPath = '/assets/styles/critical.css';
  $critical = (new Asset($kirby->root('assets') . $criticalPath))->read();
  echo '<style>' . $critical . '</style>';

  // Non-Critical
  $cssPath = '/assets/styles/main.min.css';

  echo Bnomei\Fingerprint::css($cssPath, [
    'integrity' => true,
    'media' => 'print',
    'onload' => 'this.media="all"',
  ]);

  echo '<noscript>' . Bnomei\Fingerprint::css($cssPath, ['integrity' => true]) . '</noscript>';
} else {
  echo css('assets/styles/main.css');
}
```

When running `npm run build`, this generated critical CSS, loads it first and then non-critical CSS asynchronously.

**Note:** If you are using CSP headers, see [this issue](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS/issues/312) for more information.

### Favicon generation
After generating favicons, insert this in your `<head>`:

```html
<!-- Favicons -->
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="<?= url('favicon.ico') ?>">
<?php snippet('favicons') ?>
```

### Self-hosting fonts
If you already have font files (or at least one), that's great. Otherwise, there's FontSquirrel's [webfont generator](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator) (including subsetting, file conversion, CSS generation and much more).

If Google Fonts are what you want, then [this](https://github.com/majodev/google-webfonts-helper) might be helpful.

After learning about [webfont strategies](https://www.zachleat.com/web/comprehensive-webfonts), you might want to subset your fonts, but rather than doing it manually (uploading, configuring, downloading, ..), let the machine handle it for you: This boilerplate supports font subsetting via [`glyphhanger`](https://github.com/filamentgroup/glyphhanger) when building for production. In order to use this feature, you have to install [`pyftsubset`](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools) via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip) first:

```text
pip install fonttools
```

### Preloading fonts
This goes beautifully with preloading - simply insert this in your `<head>`:

```html
<!-- Fonts -->
<link rel="preload" href="/assets/fonts/my-font.subset.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>
```

### Icons
For modern SVG icons, there are great sources out there, such as:

- Dev Icons
- Eva Icons
- Feather Icons
- Hero Icons
